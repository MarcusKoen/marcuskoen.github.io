title: Fuck it all. Time for a new language. Let us weeb it out.

# In the beginning God said: "weebC is the true programming language", and there was light.
First things first: General theory and scope.
# Phase 0

# What level programming language
Essentially we have 3 options:
1. Compiled -> bytecode -> VM
2. Native code
3. Interpreted AST walker

Due to my knowledge in reverse engineering, designing custom VM is the route I will take.

# Paradigm
1. I will be using an Imperative + Functional approach.
2. Explicit memory control

# Flavour
1. Keywords in slang
2. Types named after tropes
3. Compiler errors as ( I cannot believe I am actually doing this) anime tsundere insults

Keep in mind: Syntax is anime, but the semantics are deadly serious and non-negotiable.
